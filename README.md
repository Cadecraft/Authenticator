## Running the server:

Prerequisites:
```
cargo install wasm-pack
npm install -g typescript
```

Run this command in the `wasm_modules` folder to build the wasm:
```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Run this command in the main `Authenticator` folder to compile to js:
```
npx tsc server.ts
```

Run this command to actually run the server on port `5005`:
```
node server.js
